# RSGHB_Examples
This repository provides a number of examples to use when estimating Hierarchical Bayesian models with the RSGHB R Package. The package requires the user to specify the model likelihood function directly, offering more control over the model specification than is possible with other packages.

The main RSGHB repository can be found here:
