# RSGHB_Examples
This repository provides a number of examples to use when estimating Hierarchical Bayesian models with the RSGHB R Package. The package requires the user to specify the model likelihood function directly, offering more control over the model specification than is possible with other packages.

Example model structures include:

- MNL with fixed effects
- MNL with random effects
- MNL in WTP-Space
- MNL with log-normal parameter distributions
- MNL with parameter constraints
- Nested Logit
- Ordered Logit
- Ordered Probit
- Error Components Logit
